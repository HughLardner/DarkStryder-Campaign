## GEOGRAPHY 
The Sword Coast is on the western coast of the continent of Faerun. It runs 1400 miles north to south, and 600 miles east. The Spine of the World Mountains border the north. The deadly and unnatural Anauroch Desert borders the east. The coastline is jagged and treacherous with few safe harbors.  The three main cities (and ports) along the coast are Baldur’s Gate in the south, then Waterdeep, and Neverwinter in the north.  These cities are populated with every race but are primarily human.  Waterdeep, the City of Splendors. Home to 100,000 citizens and 200,000 plots. Led by a group of masked lords, one lord is known as “Open Lord” & is aided by an Arch-Mage, called the Blackstaff  Baldur’s Gate has more people per square inch than any city.  Run by 4 “Dukes” and protected by the Flaming Fist mercenary group, the city has never fallen.    

## RACES

The Dwarven kingdoms exist under the mountains and hills to the north and east.  The Forest cities of the Elves are spread throughout the midlands. Halfling villages are sprinkled in the fields and rolling hills to the south.  Few Gnome settlements exist. There is no Half-Orc society, forced to live on the outskirts of civilization. Dragonborn and Tiefling races are shrouded in myth. Dragonborn live alone, while Tieflings create small areas (or even one house) within a town in which to live.
